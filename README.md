# Fire-detection-using-CNN
This was a model in my graduation project in the last college year. The idea of the project was a smart city management system where surveillance cameras were attached to light poles to automatically detect many things by computer vision and then perform an action as a response. So one of the things to detect is fire and a buzzer shall make a sound if a fire is detected.
